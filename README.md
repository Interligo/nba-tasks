# Disclaimer about this repository

This repository contains various scripts, programs or just pieces of code that I executed to learn programming and to work with the github.

I will maintain a list of the completed test tasks for easy navigating:

1. [Script](https://github.com/Interligo/script-for-data-uploading-to-website) for getting an information from Airtable, saving data to Postres and uploading to a simple web-site on Django;
2. [Script](https://github.com/Interligo/script-to-creating-sitemap) for creating a sitemap in xml-format;
3. [Script](https://github.com/Interligo/script-to-get-logs) for getting logs from test-server;
4. [Script](https://github.com/Interligo/script-for-testing-json) for testing JSON-schemas.

If you are here, then most likely you are either my colleague in the training course (in that case, welcome) or someone who is trying to evaluate my programming skills (please show me your indulgence, so here's a cat).
