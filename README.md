# Disclaimer about this repository

This repository contains various scripts, programs or just pieces of code that I executed to learn programming and to work with the github.

If you are here, then most likely you are either my colleague in the training course (in that case, welcome) or someone who is trying to evaluate my programming skills (please show me your indulgence, so here's a cat).
